  APNS) for task reminders and real-time alerts.
- **Authentication & Security**: Implements OAuth 2.0, JWT-based authentication, and AES encryption
  for local data protection.
- **Automated Testing & CI/CD**: Utilizes Flutter Test Framework, GitHub Actions, and SonarQube for
  code quality enforcement.
